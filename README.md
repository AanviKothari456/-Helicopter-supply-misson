Welcome to the Helicopter Project! In this project, you'll be controlling a helicopter to deliver packages to specific locations. Your goal is to safely land the package at the designated spot by controlling the helicopter's movement.

Gameplay:

You control the helicopter to deliver a package to a specific location.
The package is attached to the helicopter and must be released at the right moment to land it safely.
The helicopter can move horizontally across the screen.
Once the package is released, it falls due to gravity and interacts with the environment.
Controls:

Use the arrow keys to control the horizontal movement of the helicopter.
Press the down arrow key to release the package and attempt to land it.
Package Delivery:

The package is initially attached to the helicopter and moves with it.
When you press the down arrow key, the package is released and falls due to gravity.
The goal is to land the package on the designated spot accurately.
